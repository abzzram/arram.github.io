PCA 
-----

This presentation was made as a brief introduction to PCA to new members of the Albeck Lab.

Welcome to a brief tutorial on how to conduct a standard PCA in matlab using featureized single-cell traces. 

This dataset was created by live-cell ERK biosensor imaging of three cell types responding to Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) or Epireguulin (EREG).

PCA is:

For more details on the math behind PCA, here's a greate video from stat quest: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgakZw6K1QQ

Single-cell traces were "featurized" into different characteristics which make up the columns of the data. Each row is a single cell. 
Featurization can be done using our custom function "ct_pulseanalysis". We also include information about the cell type and ligand.

    Each column represents a distinct features of the ERK biosensor.


Before running the PCA function, we will "standardize" the data to make the columns more comparable.

    Notice that standardization does not change the distribution.

Now we are ready to the the princple component analysis using matlabs pca funciton. 
It has several outputs which we will be looking at.

    The scores are particularly important because they will help us visualize the data in reduced dimensions. 

Next, we look at the "pareto" plot, to see how much variance is explained by the principle components. 
We see that, the first PC explains 50% of the varaince, which is very good for our data!
This means that about half of the variation in our single-cell ERK data can be explain by a single component.

We can gain an intuition about how each princple component is made by looking at the loadings output. 
Here we see that the first principle component as the overall ERK response to stimulation by EGF.

    PC1 loadings

We can do the same with PC2 (and so on), seeing that the second principle componenent is the pulsatility of the resopnse to EREG.

Finally, we can use the scores output to visualize the data in PC space. By coloring each plot by different groupings, we can find patterns in the data. 
For example, we see that each cell type have unique responses profiles (left), and the ligands themselves also have unique profiles!
